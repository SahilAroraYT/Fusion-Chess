            Help your child develop strong listening skills. Strengthen their critical thinking as they learn to assess, combine, and apply knowledge through weekly assignments. Teach them how mindset and values impact their performance. Chess tournaments and competitions also build your childâ€™s confidence, encourage creative problem-solving, teach them how to handle winning and losing with grace, and show them that actions have consequences.
